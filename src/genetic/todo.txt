• Documented code (Python, C++, C, Java, Matlab)
– Make sure that each group member codes something, add
names to code (who did what?)
– Upload plain files to Student portal or zip archive
• Final demonstration of evolved behaviour in class
in three weeks (Carnival in between!!!)
• Intermediate demonstration EA on benchmark
functions (same demos as for PSO, show updates
of individuals) in two weeks (= after Carnival)
• Short research paper with abstract, methods
(describe your EA & control), experiments, results,
and discussion.




Report:
• Control (e.g. drawing of ANN)
• Morphology (here simulation)
• Genetic representation -> exact genome
• Population size -> exact number
• Initialization (how do you initialize genomes?) -> exact distributions and
motivation
• Exact fitness function + motivation
• Evaluation procedure + motivation
(experiments, how do you measure?)
• Selection and reproduction (be precise)
• Crossover & mutation (be precise)
• Stop criterion
• Data analysis (figures! describe results, explain, and discuss! Analyse
possible causes for your results. This section might take more than a page
of text)
